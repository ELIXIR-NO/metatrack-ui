					Life-science data are often scattered across institutions, stored in
					incompatible formats, or restricted due to privacy and regulatory
					requirements. This fragmentation limits discoverability,
					collaboration, and reuse.

				<h5>
					MetaTrack addresses these challenges by providing a trusted national
					platform for structured data management and controlled sharing. It
					enables Norwegian research groups, hospitals, and laboratories to
					manage data responsibly while aligning with international FAIR
					(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.

					By improving metadata quality and interoperability, MetaTrack
					strengthens data discoverability and long-term value.
